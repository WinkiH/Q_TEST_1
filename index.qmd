# About me

### Who am I?

Hello! This is Winki currently doing MSc Urban Spatial Science at CASA UCL. This is my fourth year spending in the UK but the first year in London!

I studied BSc Geography at Durham University then straight to this masters degree after my graduation in 2023. I love travelling around the world and exploring the nature :). Oh yes! I am from Hong Kong, a densely populated city (phew). But I am more drawn to some quiet and tranquil places like the Isle of Skye or the other parts of Scotland!

### Fun facts about me

-   I love scrolling through Google Map/ Google Earth (This gives me some travelling vibe!)

-   I prefer taking buses rather than tube (except DLR) as I could see the view outside

-   I don't actually like coding...

-   I love doing road trip but I don't have a driving license

-   I like sun bathing and getting tanned, in other words, I dislike winter
